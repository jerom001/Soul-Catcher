# 🎮 Soul Catcher

**Soul Catcher** is a fast-paced arcade game prototype focused on reflex, timing, and survival.  
The player must catch the correct souls while avoiding dangerous ones, with difficulty increasing over time.

This project was built as part of my game development journey, focusing on **core gameplay mechanics**, **player feedback**, and **scalable difficulty systems** rather than heavy polish.
